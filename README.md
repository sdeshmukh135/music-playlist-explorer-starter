### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics discussed in the labs did prepare me to complete the assignment, specically labs like the book club lab which helped not only when form generating for the stretch features but also with adding in HTML elements through Javascript, making my HTML much cleaner for dynamic addition of playlists and songs. I felt a bit unprepared when it came to adding a new page, which was a bit confusing as I was not sure if my script.js would be able to figure out which event listeners were for which pages.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would focus on making my code cleaner, making sure that functions or methods that had to do with a specific feature we grouped together, likewise for CSS. I would have love to do more error-handling as I noticed a few places where error-handling would have been useful as well.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

In general, I believe I should have read ahead on the milestones to predict the functionality and plan my javascript accordingly. For the first few milestones I had hardcoded a lot of the information, which I later spent a lot of time reversing as we began to implement javascript.
